# SoccerStars
A soccer game simulator using RSDL library.

This project is mainly about object-oriented programming which I was thaught 
in my Advanced Programming course (Fall 2020).

For running the code , it's required to have the RSDL library and some pictures 
related to the events in the game (all included in the repository).

How to run : 
`make` `
./soccerStars.out`
